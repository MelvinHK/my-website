            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>My parents gifted me my first drawing tablet when
                I was around 14, a <i>Wacom Intuos CTH-480.</i> My first drawing software was recommended by a friend,
                <i>Paint Tool SAI.</i> Before this, I drew with pencil and paper, extensively doodling in school
                notebooks and making comics with folded A4 paper; the former still carries on.
            </p>
            <p>In my first year of senior highschool, my parents, again, gifted me the luxury of a screen tablet, the
                <i>Wacom Cintiq Pro 13.</i> It was between this time and middle university that I was most actively
                drawing, using Adobe Photoshop and later Clip Studio Paint EX.
            </p>
            <p>I am most thankful for the catalyst that is my parents' generosity, which allowed me to explore
                digital art at an early age.</p>

            <h2>Interest</h2>
            <p>I'd like to describe my art as 'minimalist', may that be a cover for my laziness. I particularly enjoy
                focusing on linework. Some of my favourites:</p>
